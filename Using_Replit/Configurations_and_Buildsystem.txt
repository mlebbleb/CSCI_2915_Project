Build System Changes:

In its defualt state, the replit make file is setup to compile every .cpp file into one exicutable
named main. This can cause issues when the students create multiple files containing a main
function. 

This can be solved by modifying the Makefile of the replit to only compile the files in a certian
directory and only placing the desired files in the source directory. This can be acomplished using
the Makefile provided in the bild systems directory of this repository.

Configuration Changes

Build System:

When the Makefile is changed in order to improve the build system, the configurations should
be changed to allow the repl's run button to function as the students would expect.This can be
acomplished by changing the run variable to include the path to the main binary, changing the 
variable from "./main" to "./<dir_name>/main". 

Other Changes:

Removing the -s flag from the list of comands assigned to the compile variable will cause the
individual compiler comands produced by the makefile to be displayed in the terminal when the run
button is pressed.  This will help the students see the actions the compiler is taking when the
code is copiled, potentialy helping them get a better understanding of the process of using the
compiler.

Removing "Makefile" from the list of heden files assigned to hidden will allow for access to the
makefile when hidden files are hidden. This will make it easier for students to see and make
changes to the makefile if neccessary potentialy allowing them to get a better idea of how the
build system is working. 

    Before Changes:

        compile = ["make", "-s"]
        run = "./main"
        entrypoint = "main.cpp"
        hidden = ["main", "**/*.o", ".ccls-cache", "Makefile"]

    After Changes:

        compile = ["make"]
        run = "./<bin_dir_name>/main"
        entrypoint = "main.cpp"
        hidden = ["main", "**/*.o", ".ccls-cache"]
