***********************************************************************************************

Replit is the primary text editor we will be using in this course. It has great suport for 
colaborative programing and, as it browser based, does not require the students to install
any software on there divice. 

While Replit is very useful, it has some issues that will need to be worked around in class.
These issues will be addressed here in adition to some other helpful tweaks and informatoin
that can make the students experiance with the software easier.

Using Replit

    Access:
        Replit can be accessed by going to https://replit.com
        
        The students should be able to log in using there University email acount.

    Creating a Team:
        Once the students have loged into there acounts, have the students create a new team.
        This will create an area for the students to creat a set of shared Repls, which the
        students will be able to easily access without having to invite each other for each new
        Repl created.

        To do this, access the menu on the left-hand side of the screen; If the menue is not
        visable, click the three bars in the top left corner and it should appear. Click on the
        menue item labled "Teams". Once in the teams page, scroll down to the bottom of the
        screen to the "Friends" section and click on the "New team in Friends" button. Fill in
        the team name and the team user name. After the team is created add each member of the
        group to the team using each others usernames or emails.

    Creating a Team Repl:
        Repls are the individual code environments the students will be writing there programs
        in.

        In order to create a Team Repl, enter the team you want to create the team repl in and
        click on "Create Team Repl" select the desired language (C++) and give the Repl a name 
        and click on "Create Repl".

        Once the Repl is complete, you can write your code in the main file, or you can create
        other files to write your code in.

    Accessing Configurations and Build System:
        In order to access the repl's configurations and build system, click on "Show Hidden Files"
        in the dropdown menu (accessed by clicking on the three vertical dots) This will show the
        repl's Makefile and configuration files (the .replit file).

        More information on modifing the configurations and build system can be found in
        Configurations_and_Buildsystem.txt
