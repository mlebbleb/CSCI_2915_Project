IDEs and text editors are the programs used to write and, depending on the software, run your
code.  Bellow I have included some options for students I believe to be of merit or particularly
useful for this course.

My Preferances:

I personaly use VSCode for the majority of my programing in C/C++. In my opinion it provides
and easy to use, estheticaly pleasing, and very costomizable environment. In addition, the vast 
amount of plugins provide the program with a lot of versatility and functionality.  Atom can
provide all these things as well and really, my preferance for VScode comes as it was the program
I used first and have had the most time to costomize to my liking.
